These files are using the TechSmart Coding platform. These are for instructional purposes to show students a sample of projects and how they can be achieved.

# Unit 1

Unit one does not have a project associated with it, but these programs are what are learned.

## Unit1_MadLibs.py

This Python program generates a Madlib story by prompting the user to input words for various categories such as adjectives, foods, vehicles, verbs, colors, nouns, and more. The program then uses these inputs to fill in the blanks of a pre-defined story template, creating a humorous or nonsensical story. Finally, it prints out the completed Madlib story.

# Unit 2

### Criteria

- Use conditional syntax to make decisions
- Use code from a built-in library such as math or random
- Use boolean logic to make a complex decision using an and, or, or not operator
- 
## Unit2_molarmass_calc.py

This program calculates the molar mass of a chemical compound based on the user's input of its chemical formula. The user is prompted to enter elements and their respective counts in the formula. The program then looks up the atomic masses of the entered elements and calculates the molar mass of the compound. The molar masses of individual elements are hard-coded into the program.

# Unit 3

### Criteria

- Use at least one while loop and one for loop
- Use at least one loop control statement (break, continue, or else)
- Use at least three sprites within a tsapp GraphicsWindow
- Use keyboard or mouse input
  
## Unit3_asteroids.py

This program is a simple 2D game called "Asteroids." It uses the tsapp library for graphics and user input. The game involves a spaceship (controlled by the user) that can move horizontally and vertically, rotate, and shoot bullets. The objective is to destroy asteroids that appear on the screen.

# Unit 4
### Criteria

- Use a list to store a collection of user data; some examples of common user data include:
  - names
  - phone numbers
  - addresses 
- Use at least one list method or function that operates on lists
- Modify strings with string methods or slicing
  
## Unit4_contact.py

This program is a simple contact manager that allows users to perform various operations on a list of contacts. 

# Unit 5

### Criteria

- Use the requests library to load data from a web API
- Allow the user to make one or more choices to determine what specific information is requested
- Present the information in an easy to understand format

## Unit5_DND_Random_Character.py

This program uses the D&D 5e API to fetch data about classes, races, and skills. The character's attributes are generated based on a combination of a base score, point buy distribution, and racial modifiers. The program also considers class-specific attribute priorities and randomly allocates points to class skills.

This program is not complete yet, there are many things that do not work properly.

## Unit5_Molar_Mass_calc.py

This program is not complete yet, there are many things that do not work properly.

# Unit 6
### Criteria

- Use at least three user-defined functions
- Use at least one variable with a default value
- Use at least on variable-length parameter
- Modify a variable as a function side effect using the global keyword or pass-by-referenece
- Document at least one function using a doctring
  
## Unit6_Password_Checker.py

This program is designed to check the strength of a password based on certain criteria.
