Unit5_DND_Random_Character.py
    This program uses the D&D 5e API to fetch data about classes, races, and skills. The character's attributes are generated based on a combination of a base score, point buy distribution, and racial           modifiers. The program also considers class-specific attribute priorities and randomly allocates points to class skills.

    This program is not complete yet, there are many things that do not work properly.
